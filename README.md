# Request_Acknowledge_UVM

This project's purpose was to learn about UVM methodology. I implemented the UVM environment from scratch; I had an interface for the master and one for the slave. The project features a specialized UVM driver responsible for generating and driving request transactions. Complementing the Request Driver, the Acknowledge Driver is responsible for generating acknowledge responses based on the requests.
